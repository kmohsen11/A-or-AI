# I or AI: Distinguishing Human from AI-Generated Text

## Project Overview
This project aims to differentiate between human-written text and text generated by AI models, such as ChatGPT. Utilizing various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, Random Forest, and Extra Trees Classifier, the project analyses conversations between users and ChatGPT.

## Data Collection and Preprocessing
The dataset comprises conversations in JSON format, converted to CSV using Python libraries like JSON and Pandas. Key steps in preprocessing include selection of relevant fields (text and sender), and cleaning the dataset (e.g., filtering out messages with less than 10 words).

## Models and Methodology
We employed multiple machine learning models, each undergoing specific preprocessing and text tokenization methods. For instance, the neural network model involved vectorizing messages and using an embedding layer. Models were trained and evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores.

## Results
The models achieved an accuracy around 51-52% and an F1-score of about 50%, indicating a slight improvement over random guessing. These results highlight the challenge in distinguishing AI-generated text from human-generated text with current methods.

## Future Work
Improvements could include advanced data preprocessing, exploring more complex models, feature engineering, ensemble techniques, and acquiring a more varied dataset.
